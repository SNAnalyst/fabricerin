Bewteen my first CRAN submission and now I've introduced many new features and fixed many bugs. I'd apprecitae if I could push these improvement to CRAN today, of course if it's possible. The improvements include: 

- The possibility to export the drawing canvas; 
- The possibility to erase the drawing interactively;
- The possibility to include many canvas in one page that work independently from each other; 
- The possibility to choose the width of the eraser within the fabric_drawing function;
- Many bug fixing.
